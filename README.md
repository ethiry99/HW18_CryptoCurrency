# HW18_CryptoCurrency

In this challange we are working with cryptocurrency data to group them together using unsupervised learning.

The first step in this process is clean up the data.  Unnecessary data like crypto that doesn't trade is removed as well as nulls.  The data is also shaped and repeated columns or columns with identical data also removed.

After scaling the data to prevent a single category from overstated or understaed influence a clustering algorithm im utilized to group like cryptocurrencies.

The results are visualized as a 3D plot, a table, and a scatterplot.
